# AudioHandler

## Save audio, play it back through your output and virtual mic!

1. requires VB Cable, since it will latch on to "Cable Input" render device that is found for output.
2. Will pass through your default windows input mic, and playback to your default windows output.

## TODO
1. Better UI styling
2. Ensuring synchronization is truly safe
3. tests ??
4. Dynamic audio IO handling (currently hardcoded on 48khz sample single channel in)
